Welcome to my git repo where I push anything and everything that I do!

## About me

- I like a lot of things, I try to do said lot of things, some workout and some don't but I did do it in the end.
- I am exploring a lot right now, currently I am looking at LRM research, NLP, Gen AI.
- I hope to learn Genomics and Bioinformatics and do computational work on that.
- A uni student with no time and all the time, I want to do what makes me feel like me.
- Let's connect if we have anything in common and do work we both will enjoy -  work that can change the world.
- Oh yeah and finally, I want to make things that can change the world, so ride along or watch from the sides.
